# Automata
An experiment used to learn how to build a **[Finite State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)** with **[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)**.
This is just an experiment, also incomplete, non-working and used solely to learn something new. Please, do not use for production purpose.

## How to
Using `docker` and `docker-compose`:

```
$ docker-compose run --rm app sh
$ mix test
```
